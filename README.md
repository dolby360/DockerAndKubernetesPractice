# Docker And Kubernetes Practice

While taking [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide/) on Udemy, I'm saving examples with explanations about dockers and kubernetes for future use.

Every directory will contain the relevant code, README.md file, Dockerfile, and other kubernetes configurations.

This repo can be handy as a cheat sheet, also for documenting my learning.
